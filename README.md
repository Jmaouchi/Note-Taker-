# Summary:
  An app that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.
  

# Technology

**2. [CSS](https://css.com)**


**3. [Bootsrtap](https://bootstrap.com/)**  


**4. [HTML](https://html.com/)**


**5. [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** :

* Web Applications : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* APIs : With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

* Performance : Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.


**6. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** : 

* Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

* A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

* Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

**7. [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)** : Creates random unique id's.
